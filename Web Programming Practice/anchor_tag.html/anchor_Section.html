        <h1>OOP Concept </h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Pillar 1: Abstraction</h2>

        <p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The
            trivial or non-essential units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its
            individual components.</p>

        <p>Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an
            object,
            ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors of an object differentiate it from other
            objects
            of
            similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the object.</p>

        <p>Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will
            increase
            the car speed or applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator,
            the
            speed
            is actually increasing. He does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the
            accelerators, brakes etc. in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>

        <h2>Pillar 2: Encapsulation</h2>
        <p> It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together the
            code
            and
            the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is that it is a protective shield that
            prevents
            the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.</p>

        <p> Technically, in encapsulation, the variables or the data in a class is hidden from any other class and can
            be
            accessed only through any member function of the class in which they are declared.
            In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, which is similar to what data-hiding
            does.
            So,
            the terms “encapsulation” and “data-hiding” are used interchangeably.
            Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing public
            methods in
            the
            class to set and get the values of the variables.</p>

        <h2> Pillar 3: Inheritance</h2>
        <p> Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by
            which
            one
            class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. We are achieving inheritance
            by
            using extends keyword. Inheritance is also known as “is-a” relationship.</p>

        <h3>Let us discuss some frequently used important terminologies:</h3>

        <h4>Superclass:</h4> The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass (also known as base or parent
        class).
        Subclass: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass (also known as derived or extended or
        child
        class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
        Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of <b>“reusability”</b>, i.e. when we want to create a new class
        and
        there is
        already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing
        class. By
        doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

        <h2>Pillar 4: Polymorphism</h2>
        <p> It refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities with the
            same
            name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities. The
            ability
            to appear in many forms is called polymorphism.</p>

        <a id="exception"></a>
        <h1>Exception Handling in java </h1>
        <p>In Java, Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e.
            at
            run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programs instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled
            by
            the program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the
            exception
            object. It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and
            the
            state of the program when the exception occurred.</p>

            <a id="interfaces"></a>
        <h1>Interfaces in Java </h1>
        <p>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. Traditionally, an interface could only have
            abstract
            methods (methods without a body) and public, static, and final variables by default. It is used to achieve
            abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java. In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that
            other
            classes must implement. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.</p>

            <a id="operator">\</a><br/>
            <h1>instanceof of operator</h1>
            <p>The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or
                subclass or interface).
            </p>
