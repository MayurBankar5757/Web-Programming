    <h1>Interfaces in Java </h1>
    <p>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. Traditionally, an interface could only have abstract
        methods (methods without a body) and public, static, and final variables by default. It is used to achieve
        abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java. In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other
        classes must implement. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.</p>
