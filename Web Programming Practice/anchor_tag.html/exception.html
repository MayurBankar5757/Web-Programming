    <h1>Exception Handling in java </h1>
    <p>In Java, Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at
        run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled by
        the program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception
        object. It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the
        state of the program when the exception occurred.</p>
