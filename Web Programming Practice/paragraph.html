    <h1>Linked List Data Structure</h1>
    <p>
        A <b>linked list</b> is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion
        and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like
        <u>stack</u>, queue and deque. Here the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays

    <h3>Linked List:</h3>

    <b>Data Structure:</b> Non-contiguous
    <b>Memory Allocation:</b> Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
    <b>Insertion/Deletion:</b> Efficient
    <b> Access:</b> Sequential</p>

    <h1>Stack Data Structure</h1>
    <p>
        A <b>Stack </b>is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The
        order may be <u>LIFO</u>(Last In First Out) or <u>FILO</u>(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted
        last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.</p>
